# Polly Reference Images

This folder contains reference images of Polly, ALF's pink penguin friend.

## Usage

Place Polly reference images in this folder to use them during ALF & Polly image generation. The system will automatically load these images and use them alongside ALF reference images to generate more consistent results.

## Supported Formats

- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- BMP (.bmp)

## Description

Polly is a cheerful pink penguin who loves adventures with ALF. Her key characteristics:
- Pink coloration
- Penguin features (beak, flippers, etc.)
- Cheerful and playful personality
- Friendly expression
- Small, cute proportions that complement ALF's larger crocodile form

## How It Works

When generating ALF & Polly adventures:
1. The system loads both ALF reference images (from /references/) and Polly reference images (from /references/polly/)
2. Both sets of references are combined and sent to the image generation model
3. This helps maintain consistency for both characters in the generated images
